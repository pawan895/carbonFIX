# React Solana Carbon Credit Tokenization Project

This project is a React application that allows users to tokenize carbon credits on the Solana blockchain and set up trades within the Solana network. It provides an interface for users to interact with the Solana blockchain, create carbon credit tokens, and trade them with other participants.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version 12 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Solana Command Line Tool (CLI)

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get the project up and running:

1. Clone the 
2. Install project dependencies:
3. Configure Solana network:

- Ensure you have Solana CLI installed. If not, follow the installation instructions from the Solana documentation.
- Connect to a Solana cluster. You can use a testnet cluster for development or the mainnet cluster for production.
- Create a Solana wallet and obtain a keypair. You can use the Solana CLI to generate a keypair.

4. Configure the project:

- Open the `.env` file in the project root directory.
- Set the environment variables:
  - `REACT_APP_SOLANA_NETWORK` - Set the Solana network URL (e.g., `https://api.devnet.solana.com` for the Solana Devnet).
  - `REACT_APP_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` - Set the private key of your Solana wallet.
  - `REACT_APP_TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID` - Set the program ID for the token on the Solana blockchain.

5. Run the project:

6. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.

## Usage

The React Solana Carbon Credit Tokenization application provides the following features:

- **Token Creation**: Users can create carbon credit tokens by providing the necessary information such as credit amount, description, and issuer details. The application will interact with the Solana blockchain to mint and associate the token with the provided metadata.

- **Token Trading**: Users can list their carbon credit tokens for trade or browse available tokens to purchase. The application facilitates the execution of trades by connecting buyers and sellers and managing the transfer of token ownership within the Solana network.

- **Transaction History**: The application maintains a transaction history that displays all the token creation and trading activities within the Solana blockchain. Users can review their own transaction history and track the progress of their trades.
